# Are we there yet? Faster Pediatric Care With Machine Learning Directives

The following repository contains the original python files and software code used in the development of machine learning medical directives project 
  
  1. Preprocess.py
    - Outlines the initial preprocessing steps used to generate labels and prepare EHR data for model training and testing
    
  2. Main.py 
    - Contains software that trains all three machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, neural network) and generates initial outcome metrics
  
  3. Threshold.py
    - Contains software for selecting model thresholds and generating corresponding model outcome metrics
  
  4. SHAP.py 
    - Contains software for generate SHAP values and corresponding plots for the top performing models for each machine learning medical directive use case
